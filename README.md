# Thomson die management
In this project, we are trying to make a system that can manage numerous thomson die.
At now, each thomson die have a RFID tag. But, doesn't have data of size of box build by the thomson die. 
Therefore, we make a system that take a photo of thomson die and link to the RFID and after that, use CV to measure(determine) of the boxes build by the thomson die.

# whats in this repo
This repository have a software that has UI, function of scanning the RFID and take picture.
